Theory: 

C++ is programming language that is procedural, object-oriented, and generic in nature. The language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ is an extension of C, adding classes and objects to enhance its capabilities. At its core, C++ programs consist of functions, variables, and control structures.

C++ introduces the concept of classes, which encapsulate data and functions which brings about object-oriented programming. Objects are instances of classes, allowing data abstraction and inheritance. Operator overloading and templates enhance functionality, enabling code flexibility.

Standard libraries in C++ are crucial because they contain needed functions and data structures, which include vectors, lists and strings. These comprise bold container classes and algorithms in Standard Template Library (STL). There is a solid error management provided by exception handling.
